Introduction
------------
The project goal is to instantiate a local Concourse CI cluster and blog site for personal needs. I run it on Mac OS 10.12.6 but code can be easily tweaked to run on Linux. YMMV. Feel free to fork and modify to fit your needs.

Requirements
------------
- MacOS, 8 GB RAM, 16 GB recommended.
- 5 GB of free disk space, 20 GB or more recommended until Docker fixes the qcow2 disk space eater [bug](https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/371).
- https://github.com/xenolf/lego/releases (it will be installed if missing).

Usage
-----
### up
Run `./ci --help` for command help.

The `./ci up` command instantiates a docker based Concourse CI cluster and associated services on the local computer. Each cluster service runs in its own container. Cluster features:
  - one Concourse web node
  - one Concourse worker
  - a private Docker registry
  - an Nginx reverse proxy server
  - a Postgress database
  - a ghost blog service

It also generates all internal certificates and passwords. In the end it logs in the current user into the docker registry and setup command line access to the concourse cluster using the `fly` target `.`.

### rm
The `./ci rm` command will teardown the Concourse CI cluster. This performs a `docker-compose down` to stop all related running containers then wipe out the cluster persistent state data form `./deployments`, i.e. Concourse database, credentials and Docker registry image content.

### restart
The `./ci restart` command performs a warm cluster restart. The `docker-compose.yml` and other config files like `nginx.conf` will be regenerated before the cluster is started again. The cluster state and credentials are otherwise preserved.
